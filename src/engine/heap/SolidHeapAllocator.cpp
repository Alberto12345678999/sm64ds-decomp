/* arm9/SolidHeapAllocator -- the solid-heap allocator TU: the allocator that
 * carves one free region from both ends, the Heap factory that embeds the
 * allocator inside the block it manages, and the saved-state chain kept in
 * the free region's own third word.
 * .text 0x0204e964..0x0204eda4, folded from fourteen legacy shards.
 * mwccarm emits .text in reverse source order, so the definitions below run
 * ROM-descending (C1 first, Reallocate last); the roster reads ROM-ascending.
 *
 *   Reallocate         -- in-place resize of the most recent forward alloc.
 *   TryResizeToFit     -- shrink the heap to its used extent.
 *   LoadState/SaveState -- restore points on a chain that lives inside the
 *                          heap it records: the 0x10-byte record is allocated
 *                          out of the very region it captures, and LoadState
 *                          reclaims it by rewinding past it.
 *   MemoryLeft         -- bytes a forward allocation could still get.
 *   Reset/ResetStart/ResetEnd -- rewind begin, end, or both.
 *   Allocate           -- the sign of `align` picks the direction.
 *   func_0204ebb8      -- tail-call veneer to HeapAllocator::Remove.
 *   Heap::CreateSolidHeapAllocator -- fit the allocator into the block.
 *   AllocateForwards/AllocateBackwards -- the static region carvers; they
 *                          take the free region, not the allocator, which is
 *                          what makes them static (see the header).
 *   C1                 -- the constructor; seals the free region.
 *
 * The free region is `mFreeRegion` (this + 0x24). Two views of it live here:
 * the header's SolidHeapFreeRegion {begin, end, flags}, and the TU-local
 * FreeList {begin, end, tail} for the state-chain head the flags word
 * carries at runtime.
 *
 * deslop leftovers:
 * - MemoryLeft keeps its recovered register-pressure scaffolding verbatim
 *   (new_var*, the empty `if (!(a - 1u)) {}`, the (long long)(int)
 *   round-trips): each is load-bearing under -O4,p; tidying any changes the
 *   bytes.
 * - SaveState keeps inline_fn, the recorded load-bearing spelling of
 *   `this + 0x24` in that body.
 * - Reallocate keeps the hoisted `fl` pair pointer and TryResizeToFit the
 *   opaque `struct H*` view: spelling the fields as members changes the
 *   register allocation and kills the aliased re-read of mEnd the ROM emits.
