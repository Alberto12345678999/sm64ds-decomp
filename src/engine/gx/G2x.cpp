 * The four matrix terms go out as TWO 32-bit writes, packed in pairs, each term
 * narrowed to s16 after a >> 4 -- the registers are 1.7.8 fixed point while the
 * matrix is 20.12, so the shift is the format conversion, not a scale.
 *
 * The reference point is the interesting part: dx/dy are the offset from (a,b)
 * to (c,d), and the displacement written is `m * d + (origin << 12)`. So the
 * caller gives a point to rotate ABOUT and a point to rotate TO, and this
 * resolves them into the single origin the hardware actually takes. */
