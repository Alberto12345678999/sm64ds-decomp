/* The animation-playback root, vtable _ZTV15dExtFrameCtrl_c:
 *
 *   slot 0  0x02015ce8  ~dExtFrameCtrl_c (D1)
 *   slot 1  0x02015cc4  ~dExtFrameCtrl_c (D0)
 *
 * TWO slots, nothing else. The zero word after them is adjacent data,
 * not a pure-virtual slot -- it is the offset-to-top word of the vtable
 * that follows, and all three _ZThn80_ secondary-base tables are likewise
 * two slots wide, which a derived table could not be if a third virtual
 * existed. The family's Update(ModelComponents&) is a plain method, not
 * an override. notes/model-rtti-names.md walks the pointers.
 *
 * The ROM's RTTI names this class dExtFrameCtrl_c -- a frame controller,
 * i.e. the playback cursor, not the animation data.
 *
 * The destructor is declared first, which makes it the key virtual function.
 * Each enrolled destructor-variant translation unit defines the same real
 * `dExtFrameCtrl_c::~dExtFrameCtrl_c()`; mwcc emits D2/D0/D1 together and objisolate keeps
 * the variant named by that file's enrollment.
 *
 * LAYOUT is 0x10 bytes, pinned by C2 (vptr store, +0x8 zeroed, +0xc set
 * to 0x1000 = 1.0) and read consistently by Copy/Advance/Finished:
 * frame count in the low 30 bits of +0x4 with the loop flags in the top
 * two, current frame at +0x8 as 20.12, playback speed at +0xc.
 *
 * SetAnimation's definition stays a mangled free function: its true
 * signature carries Fix12<int> and wall 6az (notes/mwccarm-codegen.md)
 * homes class-typed by-value parameters. The declaration below is the
 * real one and callers may use it.
 *
 * ModelAnim and its children carry an dExtFrameCtrl_c as a SECOND base at
 * +0x50, reached through the ROM's _ZThn80_ thunks; that is the next
 * phase, not this header's problem.

       The compiler generates D0 as "run the destructor body, then call operator
       delete on the class". Without this it emits the global `_ZdlPv`, which
       exists nowhere in this image, and the D0 comes out one relocated word
       different from the ROM -- a difference build_pin.verify CANNOT SEE,
       because it wildcards relocated words. Only the link catches it.

       This family deallocates through Memory::operator_delete2, not the actor
       heap: every D0 below ends with a call to 0x0203cbcc. dActor_c's copy of this
       member calls Memory::Deallocate instead, which is why each needs its own.

       Inline, and in the IMMEDIATE base -- mwcc inlines it only when it finds it
       in the class or one level up, as include/dActor_c.h records. No layout
       effect: a non-virtual inline member adds no field and no vtable slot. */
