"""Check symbols/actor_renames.tsv against each module's own symbols.txt.

The ledger is an append log. The last row at an address is the live claim;
every earlier row is superseded history (`tools/check_profile_campaign.py`
already reads it that way, and `tools/cpp_rename.py` overwrites by address, so
the last mangled name wins). Only that live fourth column is checked against
symbols.txt. A historical fourth column may name the coined symbol the row
introduced. Rewriting it in place to keep this gate green is what severs the
chain: the appended lineage row then sources a name no row targets.

`tools/cpp_index.py:86` still indexes every mangled fourth column, not only the
live one. A historical mangled name therefore remains a lookup key for that
address. It is not a present-tense claim, and this check does not treat it as
one.

WHERE THE BAD ROWS CAME FROM, and why they cannot be regenerated away.
`tools/actor_names.py` WRITES this file (line 282, on every run, including the
default dry run); it never reads it back. Its `parse_spawnfunc` used to scan a
fixed window past the factory's own body, ran into the NEXT class's D1, and
took that class's vtable -- "shifted every vtable and method name one class
late", as its own docstring now puts it. That defect was fixed on main
(#1418-#1423), but the checked-in ledger was never regenerated, so it is still
the pre-fix output. Regenerating today does NOT repair it: `propose()` refuses
any address that already carries a real name, and by now nearly every one does,
so a fresh run emits 1 row instead of 2,573 (measured 2026-09-02). The file has
stopped being a reproducible artifact and is now maintained in place -- which
is what this check is for.

config/**/symbols.txt is the authority: it is what the ROM build consumes and
what `dsd check symbols` validates. It is not read-only -- `class_rename.py:209`,
`import_symbols.py:166` and `actor_names.py:313 (--apply)` all rewrite it -- but
every one of those writes is applied in order to make the build emit that
symbol, so symbols.txt and the linked ROM agree by construction and the ledger
does not. This check therefore only ever moves the ledger toward symbols.txt.

SCOPE. Only the live mangled (_ZN...) and vtable (_ZTV...) row at each
address is checked. Coined source-style spellings (Foo_Spawn, g_profile_BAR)
are reconstructions that deliberately have no symbols.txt counterpart. That is
a real limit, not a clean bill of health: some coined rows carry the same
one-class shift (ov009's DockPole_Spawn / DockPole_SpawnInfo sit on MetalNet's
addresses), and this check will never see them. The summary line prints how
many live rows went unchecked, and how many earlier rows were left as history,
so the green is not read as more than it is.

CHAINS. Separately, every row's source (column 3) must be reachable from the
first source at that address by following column-3 -> column-4 edges, in any
order. An in-place rewrite plus a lineage row fails that: the lineage row
sources the coined name, and the rewritten row no longer targets it. An
append-only hop (func -> coined, coined -> rom) passes. This is a red gate.
It is safe to be one only when the checked-in ledger has no such break.
